This project creates and trains a Convolutional Neural Network Model on three publically available datasets: DRISHTI, ACRIMA and RIMONE to identify and classify fundus images of the eye into glaucomateous and non-glaucomateous with an accuracy of 96.18%.

Application demonstrating the Glaucoma detection model:- https://majorproject-hjzugm6dsdcf8rwfvpgcsn.streamlit.app/

Datasets Used:
1. Drishti: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lokeshsaipureddi/drishtigs-retina-dataset-for-onh-segmentation
2. Rim-One: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nonatosales/rimone
